# Size Shifting Potions

**REQUIRES PEHKUI**

This mod runs on Quilt, Forge, and Fabric.

Size Shifting Potions adds four new potion types to the game, that allow you to change your size. These are:
- **Growth Potion**: Strength Potion + Red Mushroom
- **Shrink Potion**: Weakness Potion + Brown Mushroom
- **Widening Potion**: Fermented Spider Eye + Growth Potion
- **Thinning Potion**: Fermented Spider Eye + Shrink Potion

## Config
As of v1.4.0, there is a config that utilizes MidnightLib, which has the following options:
- Toggling each potion, so you can disable them from being brewed.
- Switch the recipes from using Red/Brown mushrooms, to using Warped/Crimson fungus. 
- The minimum and maximum size that the status effects can change you to.
